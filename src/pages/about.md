I design and structure complex digital experiences — turning requirements, constraints, and legacy systems into maintainable, production-ready solutions.

My work centers on system architecture: defining interaction logic, component models, and content structures that hold up under real-world constraints like accessibility, compliance, legacy code, and multi-team ownership.
