I design and structure complex digital experiences — turning requirements, constraints, and legacy systems into maintainable, production-ready solutions.

My work centers on system architecture: defining interaction logic, component models, and content structures that hold up under real-world constraints like accessibility, compliance, legacy code, and multi-team ownership.

## How I Work

- Accessibility isn’t a checklist—it’s baked into the system
- Components over pages, patterns over one-offs
- Design intent validated in code early
- Documentation as a product, not an afterthought
