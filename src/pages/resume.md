# UX Engineer / Design Systems Engineer
*System Architecture • Design Systems • Accessibility*

## Professional Summary

I’m a UX Engineer with 5 years of experience designing and building scalable, accessible design systems for large public-sector platforms. My work sits at the intersection of design and front-end engineering—translating design standards into reusable components, templates, and patterns that teams can actually ship.

I specialize in USWDS-based systems, accessibility-first front-end architecture, and design system migrations. I’ve partnered closely with designers, developers, and stakeholders to establish governance models, reduce implementation drift, and enable consistent adoption across complex, multi-site ecosystems.

## Core Capabilities

- Design Systems Engineering – component architecture, atomic design, system governance

- Accessibility by Default – WCAG 2.1, Section 508, USWDS compliance

- Front-End Foundations – HTML, CSS, JavaScript

- System Architecture – templates, information architecture, responsive patterns

- Code-Based Prototyping – validating interaction, accessibility, and layout before build

- Tooling & Documentation – Figma, Framer, living documentation, enablement

- Static Site Systems – Eleventy, Jekyll

- Cross-Functional Collaboration – designers, engineers, product, stakeholders

## Professional Experience

### UX Architect - ICF Next

*June 2021 - Present*

- Designed and built an internal USWDS-based design system with reusable components, page templates, and front-end patterns supporting multiple government websites.

- Developed code-based prototypes (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to validate interaction behavior, accessibility, and responsive layouts—reducing downstream engineering rework.

- Led design system migrations from legacy Bootstrap implementations to USWDS, including component audits, dependency mapping, and phased replacement strategies.

- Partnered closely with designers and developers to align design intent with front-end implementation, improving handoff quality and system consistency.

- Facilitated workshops, internal demos, and documentation to onboard teams and promote accessible, system-driven front-end practices.

## Selected Work

### ICF DMX Pattern Library

Built a 50-component, USWDS-based pattern library with reusable templates and code-based prototypes. Supported adoption through internal workshops, demos, and documentation to enable consistent use across teams.

### Enterprise Design System Migration (DCCPS)

Audited and mapped legacy Bootstrap systems to USWDS, delivering accessible prototypes aligned with WCAG 2.1 and Section 508. Established a clear migration path for long-term maintainability.

### Multi-Platform IA Alignment (HUD)

Led information architecture redesign across HUD.gov, HUD Exchange, and HUDUser. Created repeatable IA templates to support scalable navigation and cross-site consistency.
