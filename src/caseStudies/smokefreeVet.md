## Summary

### TL;DR
One–two sentence summary describing the problem, your approach, and the outcome. Focus on **structure, systems, and impact**, not visuals.

---

## Overview

### The Challenge
Briefly describe:
- The product or system
- The user(s)
- The problem or breakdown

### The Approach
Explain your strategy at a high level:
- What you focused on
- What you deliberately did *not* do
- How constraints shaped decisions

### Project Goals
- Goal 1
- Goal 2
- Goal 3

### Guiding Principle
One concise principle that framed decision-making throughout the project.

---

## Discover

### Context
Explain how the system worked before:
- Core functions
- Dependencies
- Where friction appeared

### Analyzing User Behavior
Describe:
- Data sources (analytics, logs, audits)
- What signals revealed breakdowns

### Key Insights
- **Insight 1:** What wasn’t working and why
- **Insight 2:** Structural or behavioral mismatch
- **Insight 3:** System-level limitation

---

## Define

### Problem Statement
A clear, system-oriented articulation of the problem:
- What failed
- Who it impacted
- Why it mattered

### Constraints
- Technical constraints
- Accessibility / compliance constraints
- Time / scope / research constraints

**Explain how constraints shaped the solution space.**

---

## Explore

### Exploration & Ideation
Describe:
- What directions you explored
- What you ruled out (and why)
- Where friction remained

### Pivot: Key Insight
Call out the moment where your understanding shifted.
Focus on:
- Hidden rules
- Implicit logic
- System behavior vs user expectations

### Design Challenges & Tradeoffs
- Challenge 1 + tradeoff
- Challenge 2 + tradeoff
- Challenge 3 + tradeoff

---

## Synthesis

### System-Level Solution
Explain the final approach:
- What changed structurally
- What stayed the same
- Why this resolved the core problem

Use bullets sparingly to reinforce clarity:
- Preserved existing functionality
- Reduced cognitive load
- Made decision logic explicit

---

## Final Design

### Design Direction
Describe the final structure, not visuals:
- Layout strategy
- Component reuse
- Responsiveness
- Standards compliance

### Key Design Outcomes
- **Outcome 1:** What changed and why it mattered
- **Outcome 2:** Structural or behavioral improvement
- **Outcome 3:** Accessibility or scalability win

## Outcomes & Impact

### Results
Include measurable outcomes when possible:
- Engagement metrics
- Efficiency gains
- Accessibility improvements
- Adoption or usage signals

### Reflection
What this project reinforced about:
- Systems
- Architecture
- Decision-making under constraints

### Key Takeaways
- Takeaway 1
- Takeaway 2
- Takeaway 3
