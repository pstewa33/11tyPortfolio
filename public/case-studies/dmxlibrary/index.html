  <article class="main-content">
    <h2 id="summary" tabindex="-1">Summary</h2>
<h3 id="tl-dr" tabindex="-1">TL;DR</h3>
<p>Led the technical implementation of a reusable, accessible design system, partnering with design to translate standards into production-ready components and templates that scaled across teams.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-challenge" tabindex="-1">The Challenge</h2>
<p>In a fast-moving, multi-team environment, product teams were repeatedly solving the same front-end and accessibility problems from scratch. While a shared visual design standard existed, teams relied heavily on static mockups, which failed to capture real interaction behavior, responsiveness, and accessibility constraints.</p>
<p>I partnered closely with a UX designer to define and build a shared pattern library, translating design intent into production-ready patterns. Clear ownership boundaries were established early to ensure the system could scale without becoming a bottleneck.</p>
<p>My role focused on system architecture and implementation: converting design standards into reusable, code-based components and establishing workflows that enabled consistent adoption across teams without slowing delivery.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem" tabindex="-1">The Problem</h2>
<p>Without a shared front-end system:</p>
<ul>
<li>UI components behaved inconsistently across products</li>
<li>Accessibility decisions were re-made on every project, increasing risk</li>
<li>Static design artifacts masked real implementation constraints</li>
<li>Teams duplicated effort and introduced drift over time</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-need" tabindex="-1">The Need</h2>
<p>The organization needed a <strong>reliable, production-adjacent foundation</strong> that teams could reuse confidently while maintaining flexibility for different product needs.</p>
<h2 id="constraints-and-requirements" tabindex="-1">Constraints and Requirements</h2>
<p>The system needed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enforce accessibility and compliance by default (WCAG-aligned)</li>
<li>Scale across multiple teams working in parallel</li>
<li>Integrate with existing design and development workflows</li>
<li>Enable team autonomy without creating a centralized bottleneck</li>
<li>Support extension without fragmenting the core system</li>
</ul>
<p>These constraints required a system that was <strong>opinionated but extensible</strong>: enforcing strong defaults for accessibility and consistency, while providing clear extension points that allowed teams to adapt patterns without fragmenting the core system.</p>
<h2 id="solution-code-based-pattern-library" tabindex="-1">Solution: Code-Based Pattern Library</h2>
<ul>
<li>Base Components: A curated set of base components with defined extension points</li>
<li>Custom Components: Reusable custom components addressing common product needs</li>
<li>Page Templates: Standardized page templates for frequent use cases</li>
<li>Git Workflow: Git-based contribution and review workflow for quality control</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The library was implemented as a static site using Eleventy and hosted on Netlify, making it easy for teams to access, review, and adopt.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-i-built" tabindex="-1">What I Built</h2>
<p>I was responsible for the technical architecture and implementation of the system, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Designing and implementing core UI components as reusable, accessible HTML/CSS/JS patterns</li>
<li>Defining component APIs (props, variants, states) to balance consistency and extensibility</li>
<li>Encoding accessibility requirements directly into components (ARIA, keyboard behavior, focus management)</li>
<li>Creating page templates that demonstrated correct component composition</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example-accessible-component-defaults" tabindex="-1">Example: Accessible Component Defaults</h3>
<p>Rather than documenting accessibility as guidance, components were built with accessible defaults:</p>
<ul>
<li>Semantic HTML enforced by component structure</li>
<li>Keyboard interactions implemented at the component level</li>
<li>ARIA attributes applied consistently across variants</li>
</ul>
<p>This reduced the likelihood of teams shipping inaccessible UI, even under time pressure.</p>
<h2 id="system-architecture-and-ownership" tabindex="-1">System Architecture and Ownership</h2>
<ul>
<li>Core components were centrally owned and versioned</li>
<li>Project teams consumed and extended components without modifying the foundation</li>
<li>All changes flowed through pull requests to ensure accessibility, consistency, and maintainability</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="tradeoffs-and-challenges" tabindex="-1">Tradeoffs and Challenges</h2>
<h3 id="opinionated-standards-vs-flexibility" tabindex="-1">Opinionated standards vs. flexibility</h3>
<p>Constraining some design freedom reduced inconsistency and compliance drift across products. Flexibility was preserved through documented extension points rather than ad-hoc customization.</p>
<h3 id="shifting-teams-from-static-mockups-to-code" tabindex="-1">Shifting teams from static mockups to code</h3>
<p>Adoption required more than documentation. I ran walkthroughs, demos, and hands-on sessions to help designers and developers understand how to use and extend the system effectively.</p>
<h3 id="central-ownership-without-slowing-delivery" tabindex="-1">Central ownership without slowing delivery</h3>
<p>Versioning and opt-in updates allowed teams to adopt improvements on their own timelines without blocking active work.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="outcomes" tabindex="-1">Outcomes</h2>
<p>While formal metrics were not tracked, adoption and reuse across teams indicated clear operational benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Used as the starting point for multiple product builds</li>
<li>Reduced duplicated front-end work across teams</li>
<li>Improved consistency in component behavior and layout</li>
<li>Lower accessibility risk through standards embedded directly into components</li>
<li>Stronger alignment between design and development via shared, code-based artifacts</li>
<li>A scalable foundation that continues to evolve as new needs emerge</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="key-takeaways" tabindex="-1">Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Design systems are products</strong>: Adoption, governance, and onboarding matter as much as code.</li>
<li><strong>Production-adjacent artifacts improve outcomes</strong>: Code-based prototypes surface issues static designs cannot.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility scales best when embedded at the component level.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Clear boundaries enable speed</strong>: Defined ownership and extension points prevent drift without limiting teams.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="if-i-did-this-again" tabindex="-1">If I Did This Again</h2>
<ul>
<li>I would introduce automated accessibility checks earlier in the workflow</li>
<li>I would invest sooner in clearer upgrade and versioning communication</li>
<li>I would provide more starter templates to accelerate first-time adoption</li>
</ul>
